Hello and welcome. I'm Mark Reed, an information technologist who
specializes in not specializing – having dabbled in just about all corners of
the systems administration and software development worlds. I'm currently a
Cloud Architect with a primary focus on Amazon Web Services.

I've been at this for almost 40 years, over 30 professionally, so I've
built up a decent store of knowledge, tips, and tricks, and I figured a blog
is a good way to share them. Despite the name, I will try not to do too much
\*splaining; as a straight, white, heterosexual cis-male, I'm sure I've done
plenty of that already.

The immediate impetus for this blog is my adventures in translating my shell
environment from bash to zsh in response to Apple's default shell change in
Catalina. If you're at all interested in that journey, please follow along. And
even if you're not, welcome! Come back sometime, and you might find something
more relevant to your interests!

– Mark
